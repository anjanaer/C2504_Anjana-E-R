1. Cricket Ground Boundry Sides Distances from batsman (from Pavilion End)
        Leg Side 
        Off Side  
        Straight 
        Third Man  
    Compare two cricket grounds:
        find the shortest distance from each ground 
        and compare two ground based on shortest distance 
            check which is preferred ground for batsman

    - int FindShortestDistance()
        among four distance find min 
    - bool IsShortestDistanceGt(CricketGround other)     
    
    C3: UserOfCricketGround will compare two grounds 
        will say which ground is preferred ground
